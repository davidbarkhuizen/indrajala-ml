"""
A curriculum step replayed from a saved network (docs/snap-wall-workplan.md): what further training
does to it, batch by batch, and whether its proof survives. From a saved step's network (optionally
converted to numpy, its weights, Adam's moments and generator kept; optionally with the snap wall
on), some epochs of a step's data drawn by a named generator, as a run's step draws them:

- **per batch**: the batch's loss before and after its update, and the update's norm (every
  parameter's change, the codebook's included), so a jump of the loss on an ordinary step (a state
  crossing a code boundary) and a run of large updates after it (Adam amplifying it) show;
- **per epoch**: the screen at the step's lengths, the certificate in both verdicts (near ties
  branched, and strict), and the code margins over the screen's first cases' states: the least
  snap ratio (every other code's distance over the snapped code's, per state; the certificate
  asks 1.05, the wall keeps 1.5) and per snapped factor the codes in use, the closest two of them
  and the farthest state from its code;
- **at the start**: the code margins of the network as loaded (with 0 epochs, only these);
- **per batch, with machines on**: the machine the network is after the update, read off by
  breadth first search over every window from every reachable state (snapped, no near ties
  branched), against the last batch's: the (state, window) pairs whose labels or next state
  changed, the states gained and lost, and the pairs wrong for the target (the certificate's
  count without its near ties). Whether a collapse starts as one transition flipped and then
  spreads, or as many at once. A change is logged as a line.

E2b' seed 6's replay from step 7 found the first: an ordinary step at batch 977 of step 8 took its
loss from 0.001 to 2.2, and the updates after it ran 6-8 times their size (the workplan's Why).
P1 (the workplan's stage 2) replayed 2 epochs of step 8 from that network's step 7, 10 times with
the snap wall off and 10 on: the proof was lost in 9 and in 8 (C1 refuted), the wall cutting the
loss's jumps about 3-fold but not the loss of the proof. The same replay, wall off, from the step-7
networks of 4 seeds that never lost a proof (1, 3, 8, 9), 5 times each, lost it in none of 20:
seed 6's collapse is its network's, not further training's in general, and neither its least snap
ratio nor its closest codes in use set it apart (the workplan's stage 2). With machines on, P1's
10 wall-off replays show every collapse starting as 1-3 (state, window) pairs flipped by an
ordinary update, silent to its batch's loss in 8, then Adam's amplified updates within 1-13
batches in 9 (the workplan's stage 2c).
