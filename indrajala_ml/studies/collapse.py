"""
A collapse trigger, generic over tasks (docs/p11-trigger-workplan.md, D5): when a step's screen has
fallen far enough from the step's peak to call the fall a collapse. Three choices, none of them
about a task:

- **the signal**: the screen's share of every answer right ("pooled"), the mean over answer kinds
  of each kind's share ("mean"), or the worst kind's share ("worst"); the kinds are whatever the
  task's accuracy tallies (division's quotient classes and queries), and a task with one kind has
  all three equal;
- **the rule**: below a fraction of the step's peak ("ratio": value < threshold * peak) or more
  than an amount below it ("fall": value < peak - threshold);
- **the floor**: fire only once the step's peak is at least this (0: always).

The default, pooled below 0.6 of the peak with no floor, is the collapse-fork workplan's trigger
(retired: `git show 89cf3a3:docs/collapse-fork-workplan.md`) exactly; a task tunes the settings,
never the code.
