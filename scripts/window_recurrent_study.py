The window-recurrent adder (docs/window-recurrent-adder-workplan.md): whether a network that reads a
window of k columns and hands a snapped state from window to window learns, through a curriculum of
window counts, to add base-3 numbers of any length, under indrajala_ml/studies/window_recurrent_study.py's
harness and indrajala_ml/data/addition_data.py's catalogue.

    python scripts/window_recurrent_study.py run CONFIG.json
    python scripts/window_recurrent_study.py status CONFIG.json
    python scripts/window_recurrent_study.py report CONFIG.json [--md FILE]
    python scripts/window_recurrent_study.py check NETWORK.json --n N [N ...]

A config names the study's directory (results/, one JSON file per run, and models/, each run's steps
and their networks in format 2), its workers, its settings and its matrix (load_config's
docstring). `run` resumes from what is on disk, a run from its last saved step, and prints a line
per finished run, then the report; it holds the machine lock, as every study. `check` loads a saved
step's network and runs the catalogue (without B3) at each length.

OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1, as every study.

Findings (stage 9), on jebel (i7-9700K), indrajala-ml 6b94933, crate 8c20e510c9a9,
`scripts/window_recurrent_matrix.json`: the curriculum arm, `k` 1, 2, 4 x `s` 4, 16 x `m` 4, 8,
16, 5 seeds, 3 steps (1 window, then 1-2, then 1-3), at most 200 epochs a step, patience 30, the
catalogue's default sizes, each step's test pass up to its first failing length (W12), 6 workers.
90 runs, none raised. Wall time 2026-10-12 21:43 to 2026-10-13 05:14 (7.5 h; 43.4 h of runs, 24.6
of them training and 18.8 testing); a run took 2-67 minutes (median 27). The results are on jebel
and pyramidon in `data/window-recurrent/matrix/results/` (90 files, listed with their sha256 in
`data/window-recurrent/matrix/results.sha256`, itself sha256 407d6ec3...7941cab9), every step's
network beside them in `models/` (156 MB), and the log in `data/window-recurrent-matrix.log`
(sha256 b47626f0...68a7dd59).

- Half the runs work (W10: a break of 16 columns or more): 45 of 90. 43 of them pass every
  property at every test length up to 64 columns, after training on at most 3 windows: 3, 6 and 12
  columns at `k` 1, 2 and 4, window ratios of 21.3, 10.7 and 5.3. The other two break at 24 and 32
  (`k` 4, one B1 case in 100,000 wrong at the next length). In every working run the carry reaches the
  whole length (`L*` = n at every test length).
- It takes the recurrence: no run works after step 1, which trains one window and so never hands
  a state on; 9 work from step 2 (2 windows; at `k` 1, two columns of training add 64), 36 more
  from step 3, and none that worked at step 2 stopped working at step 3. A working run's step 3
  passed its check in a median of 2 epochs.
- Failure is mostly all or nothing: 43 of the 45 failing runs fail at 8 columns already, most
  across B1, A2, M2-M5 (their step 3 best screens: median 0.924). A few are near misses: two `k` 4
  runs break at 12 (their trained length) with 1-2 cases in 100,000 wrong at 16, and one `k` 2 run
  misses 4 of B1's 100,000 at 8 (and a few of A1's, M3's and M5's).
- Passing the check isn't working at `k` 1: 5 runs passed their step 3 check (every triple at 1-3
  columns) and still got 0.2-8.3% of B1 wrong at 8.
- By axis: `k` 1, 2, 4 work in 16, 11 and 18 of 30 runs; `s` 4 and 16 in 24 and 21 of 45 (the
  state's width barely matters); `m` 4, 8 and 16 in 10, 16 and 19 of 30 (more codes, more working
  runs). No cell works on every seed: the best, 4 of 5, are `k` 1 `s` 16 `m` 8, `k` 4 `s` 4 `m` 16
  and `k` 4 `s` 16 `m` 16; the worst, `k` 2 `s` 16 `m` 4, on none. Within a cell the seed decides,
  so what fails is the optimisation, not the capacity: every cell has a state that can hold a
  carry (3 values), and 6 working runs use exactly 3 codes.
- The codes used by working runs: 3-11 (median 5) over the lengths tested, so a working network
  uses more codes than the carry's 3 values; the probes (stage 10) say what the others hold.
- Cost: a step 3 epoch trains in a median 6.8 s; a working run's step 3 test pass (every length)
  took a median 17.6 minutes, a failing one's (length 8 alone) about a minute.

Per cell, its seeds working and each seed's break (in columns, seeds 0-4) after steps 2 and 3, and
the codes the working seeds used:
