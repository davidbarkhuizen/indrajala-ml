"""
The window-recurrent studies timed end to end on the Rust backend (the window-program workplan's
stages 0 and 6): the cases that run the studies' own code, beside indrajala-ml's
`scripts/measurement/window_recurrent_timing.py`, whose parsing, timing, breakdown and command line
this reuses (the research-separation workplan, D3). A case is a name, its kind first:

- `long-test-family-p<p>-f<m>-U1-n<n>-c<c>`: the long test end to end at n columns, c cases of U1
  through `QueryModel.predict` and `task.evaluate` (the examples, the network, the labels, the
  checking), the network built from seed 0 (the time doesn't depend on its answers).
- `study-family-p<p>-f<m>-e<e>`: a short study run end to end, `modular_family.run` of the family
  arm (two factors of m codes, the window's output read) from seed 0 for e epochs in all, into a
  temporary directory (a real run, not one step).

The learn and forward cases are window_recurrent_timing.py's; given here they run as there.

    python scripts/measurement/window_study_timing.py [--cases CASE ...] [--repeats 5]
    python scripts/measurement/window_study_timing.py --breakdown CASE [CASE ...]

It prints the probe contract's lines (ml's scripts/measurement/ab.py, `--bench cmd`). ab.py runs it
by its absolute path, so each side's ml tree (on PYTHONPATH) supplies the library and
window_recurrent_timing.py:

    python scripts/measurement/ab.py remote --host jebel run --bench cmd --old OLD --new NEW --order ONNO \\
        -- /home/david/code/indrajala-studies/scripts/measurement/window_study_timing.py
