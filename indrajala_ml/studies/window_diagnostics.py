"""
What a window-recurrent network's state carries, read against its task's target machine: a
diagnosis of one saved step's network, cheap enough to run on every step while a study trains
(the factored-state workplan's C9', where it showed division's factors tracking only "is it zero").

On cases drawn as training draws them (the task's mixture, at its alignment), at a few lengths:

- **the answer per class**: each output class's columns, correct and in all, so a network that
  learned some classes and stalls on others shows which;
- **each factor's share** of each quantity the target's state carries: I(code; x) / H(x), the
  fraction of x's entropy the factor's code alone removes (1 when the code determines x, 0 when
  independent of it), for each of the machine's coordinates (division's A and B; a machine without
  coordinates, its state), each coordinate's zero test ("A=0") and the answer itself;
- **the state's share** of the target's state: the whole tuple of codes against the machine's state.

A factor sharing all of a coordinate holds it; one sharing a coordinate's zero test but little of
the coordinate tracks only whether it is zero. Shares are measured on samples, so a code used by
few columns can overstate one a little; the cases and lengths are fixed for every diagnosis, so
steps and runs compare.

Each diagnosis is written beside its network as step-<j>.diagnosis.json, so a study's steps are
diagnosed once, and a run being trained can be followed: each new step diagnosed as it is saved,
until the machine's lock is free (the study ended).
