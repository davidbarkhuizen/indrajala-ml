"""
The batch runner (its workplan's stage 3, retired: git show 53d7fef:docs/workplans/batch-runner-workplan.md): a controller that owns a batch's attempts
and its ledger, and a worker daemon on each machine that runs them, over newline-delimited JSON on a
TCP socket (D4). The standard library only, so the worker costs almost nothing at rest.

A batch is a directory holding `ledger.jsonl`: its first line the batch's registration (`batch`:
the mode, the attempts with their cells, tasks, seeds and cutoffs), then one line per event
(`assigned`, `started`, `ended`, `lost`, `done`). The controller rebuilds its state from it on start
(D5), so it resumes after its own restart. Each attempt names a registered cell (CELLS), never a
command line, so a worker runs nothing else; a batch may hold several cells, its attempts interleaved
onto one fleet (an older ledger names one cell, the batch's: read as each attempt's). An attempt
message carries its cell as it did before, so a worker at an older commit runs a newer controller's.

Messages (each a JSON object on one line, with `type` and the protocol's version `v`):
worker to controller `hello` (host, slots, the attempts it is running and the ended ones not yet
acknowledged), `ready` (free slots), `started` (an attempt's pid), `progress` (its last step), `ended`
(its summary); controller to worker `attempt` (an attempt to run), `drain` (no more work), `acked` (an
`ended` received: a report lost on a dropped connection is sent again on the next).
