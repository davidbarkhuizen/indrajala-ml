"""
Chow's test set (Chow 1978, the W-method): an exact, answers-only check of a learned machine against
a black box, under a state bound (machine-discovery.md's check 4; the state-formation workplan's
D42, stage B's first tool; the programme audit's F32).

A minimal Mealy machine M of n states is equivalent to a black box of at most m states over the same
tokens, both deterministic and complete, **if and only if** the two give the same outputs on every
word of the test set P · Z: P a transition cover of M (the empty word, each state's access word,
and each access word followed by every token), Z = W ∪ X W ∪ ... ∪ X^(m - n) W, X the tokens and W
a characterization set of M (words that tell every pair of its states apart). The set comes from M
alone; only its outputs need the black box, so with query access and a state bound a learned
machine is proved equal to an unknown target. Its size grows as |X|^(m - n): the bound must be
tight.
