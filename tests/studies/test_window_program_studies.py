"""
The studies' networks on the Rust window program (moved from
tests/model/networks/test_window_program_network.py, the research-separation workplan, D2): the
study's windows and the division family's network, built by the studies' own builders, are by
bits the per-layer path's, and so are their certificates and training steps; and those builders
build the library presets' networks, which ml's test checks.
