"""
The window-recurrent network's certificate against its task's machine
(docs/research-notes/window-recurrent-report.md, E1, stage 2; over any target machine, D17, stage 5;
scripts/window_recurrent_study.py's certify).

A window's work is a function of the state it receives and its k column tokens, and a snapped state
is one of the network's m codes, exactly (the codes' forward pass gives the code's own vector), so
the network is a finite-state transducer: its states the codes, its input symbols the T^k windows
(T the task's tokens: 27 for addition), its outputs k labels. The task's target is a minimal Mealy
machine over the same tokens (window_tasks: for addition the carry automaton, its states the
carries 0-2 and its labels the sum's digits). Starting from the snapped initial state (W8), breadth
first over every window, certify collects the reachable codes and, for each reachable code q and
window w, the labels D(q, w) and the next code G(q, w). The network is certified when a map phi
from its reachable codes to the target's states, with phi(start) the target's start, has for every
reachable q and every w:

- D(q, w) the target's k labels for w from state phi(q), and
- phi(G(q, w)) the target's state after w from phi(q),

and every label leads by its margin (D3): its log-probability (its logit) at least LOGIT_LEAD ahead
of the next label's. phi is fixed as the search goes, a code's state by the first window that
reaches it, then checked by every other. A case is a start state, a word of windows (the zero
columns of the alignment, W6-i, and the final window, W9, are windows like any other) and the
transducer's outputs, so a certified network is right at every length and alignment. Conversely, a
code reached with two target states fails, for one of them, on the shortest word that tells the two
apart (the target is minimal; for addition, one zero column, whose digit is the carry): the
certificate is exact, up to its margins.

The snap's margin (D3): a snap holds when every other code is at least SNAP_RATIO times as far as
the code it snaps to. Rounding elsewhere (another batch, another BLAS order) could snap a near tie
to another code, so a near tie branches: every code within the ratio is a next code too, explored
and checked as G's is. A certificate with near ties is still a proof, for either snap; they are
counted (ties) apart from wrong outputs, and those that split (split_ties: a branch into another
state of the minimised machine than the snap's, the machine's own nondeterminism, read without the
target). A label's near tie can't branch (one of its labels is
wrong): it fails the certificate. (D3 as written failed every near tie; branching proves the same
for both snaps instead, settled in stage 2.)

The search runs every window from every reachable code, failing or not: the counts of wrong labels
and states, the margins and the minimised machine (the coarsest partition of the reachable codes
that keeps D and G, the target's size for a certified network: 3 for addition) describe a near miss
too. The first failure in breadth-first order, the fewest windows, is the counterexample, as the
windows from the start and as the task's case at alignment 0, through one window more: for a wrong
state, the shortest word telling the two states apart, zero-padded to a window (for addition, a
zero window); for wrong labels, a zero window (W9).

The certificate's JSON names what stage 2 named for addition in the target's terms: wrong_outputs
(stage 2's wrong_digits), wrong_states (wrong_carries), the counterexample's kinds "outputs" and
"state" ("digits", "carry"), its state_in (carry_in) and its case (addition), with the task's name.

A factored state (the factored-state workplan, stage 6) is a machine of tuples: a state is a code
per factor (State, D4), m_1 ... m_G of them at most; "code" above reads "state", and the search,
the map phi and the minimised machine are over tuples. A snap's margin is per factor: a near tie in
any factor branches, to every combination of the factors' snapped and near-tied codes (next_states).
Each factor's readout (D9, FactorReadout) says what it holds over the reachable states: whether its
code is a function of the target's state, the target's states grouped by its codes, and that
grouping's name, a linear form of the target's coordinates (window_tasks.Coordinates: "A", "B",
"A + B", ...). The JSON writes a state as a list of codes, and phi as [state, target] pairs.

A WindowMachine is what certify reads: WindowRecurrentShape's networks through NetworkMachine, or a
stand-in (the tests').
