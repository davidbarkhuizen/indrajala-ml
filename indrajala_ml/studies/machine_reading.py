"""
Reading a snapped network's machine against its target, beyond the certificate's verdict (the
code-consolidation workplan's stage 2, the D9 probes): `by_length`, how exact the network is on
every word of each length; `breaks`, which of its transitions break, from codes that are right.

The network's machine is walked as the certificate walks it, one column a window (k 1), but on its
snapped states only (a near tie is taken on its nearest code), together with the target's: the
pairs (code, state) the start reaches. A code is **right** for a state when the network's outputs
from it agree with the target's from the state on every word of up to `d` tokens, `d` the target's
distinguishing length plus one (the workplan's D2): with right outputs, enough to tell every pair
of the target's states apart, with a token's margin. A state's **first code** is the one its
breadth-first shortest word reaches; its other codes are **extra**.

`groups` reads the network alone, with no target (the workplan's A, D1): its reachable codes grouped
by `d`-equivalence (Moore's `k`-equivalence: no word of `d` tokens or fewer tells two apart by the
network's outputs), each group's representative the code its shortest word reaches; `consolidation`
is the table that pulls each duplicate to its representative.
